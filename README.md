Welcome to the **third problem** of the React 30+ Practical Problems series! In this challenge, we will create a dynamic form that displays user input in real-time.

### Problem 3: Real-Time Form Input 📝

Build a React application with a form that updates and displays user input in real-time as they type.

**📝 Problem Description**

Create a React application that features a simple form with input fields for the user to type text. As the user types into the input field, the entered text should appear immediately on the screen. This challenge will help you practice two-way data binding and managing React state effectively.
